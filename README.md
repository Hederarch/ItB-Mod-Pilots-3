This mod is part of a trilogy! Check out the previous one here: https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-2

(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)

## What's Included
This expansion pack includes 6 more unique pilots:

![bouncer_blink](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-3/assets/66890769/0a2f2696-29db-47b0-9867-496cfa4b9577)
**Onyx** - Force Fields: (Requires 1 Power) As a free action before repairing, deploy a line of temporary barriers.

> An elite Peace Officer from Pinnacle Private Security and test pilot for the original Zenith Guard, Onyx uses a modular hardlight field to manage the Vek's attacks without violent intervention, and sees direct attacks against them as a necessary evil. Strict and by the book, he looks up to Zenith as a role model and likes to think of himself as her second in command, though he definitely isn't.

![jensen_blink](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-3/assets/66890769/f972e6c3-3d45-48e2-b572-9b4d3d30b46c)
**Jensen Anders** - Utopian: Apply a shield and permanent boost to all non-Mech allies.

> An Archive architect and man of the people at heart, Jensen avoids the personal glory of saving the world in favor of the team effort of sticking up for the little guy. Absolutely the type to say "Teamwork makes the dream work" and mean it. That said, he is all grand ideas and big talk without much else to back it up. When the battle turns dire and he's backed into a corner, he's the most cowardly of them all.

![lodge_blink_nosmoke](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-3/assets/66890769/2ae4af27-09a8-4a8a-98d9-92167e301ebd)
**Lodge** - Overdrive: (Requires 1 Power) Instead of moving, dash and explode adjacent tiles, then gain Boost. Can no longer repair.

> A semi-sentient killing machine developed in secret away from the surviving islands, Project L.O.D.G.E. is the ultimate mech pilot, capable of pushing weapons to their limits and singlehandedly slaughtering hordes of Vek, though his overclocking makes its mech a self-destructive glass cannon and renders field repairs impossible. Lodge's speech is terse and grim, loathing its role as a living weapon, but its unmatched battlefield effectiveness makes it a force to be reckoned with.

![kaiser_blink](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-3/assets/66890769/dae7d32b-e493-42d9-8d70-b98f61c89b59)
**Kaiser DuVal** - War Favors: Each mission, gain a temporary unique weapon if Mech has an empty slot.

> A warrior from a mostly forgotten old-Earth war, Kaiser is sharp and steadfast in the offensive against the Vek, adapting his training to the weapons of the modern day, as well as his network of allies. As a prolific soldier, arms trader, and alcoholic, he has a number of unsettled debts with the old airmen of his unit and calls the surviving ones in for support on the new battlefield. 

![metallica_blink](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-3/assets/66890769/ce0d894e-aea6-4f36-8f8a-3b754a7896bc)
**Metallica** - Power Couplers: (Requires 1 Power) At the start of each turn, add Boost to adjacent allies.

> A successor and Detritus counterpart to Archive's Project Pegasus from the previous pack, Metallica is an indestructible battery bank with a simple AI to command a mech. Built and trained from old-Earth wargames, Metallica is a crack shot with nearly any weapon provided an ally to stabilize itself off of, and other mechs on the field can draw from its power stores to improve their own skills. However, its virtual training has given it a strange communication style based on its simulations.

![darwin_blink](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-3/assets/66890769/2621daa5-3c64-47f4-bafb-a5d905550a7d)
**Darwin Mulligan** - Danger Flares: When reduced to 1 Health, apply Smoke to all Vek.

> A warrior from a definitely forgotten old-Earth war, Darwin prides themself on their valorous achivements, even though their reckless piloting suggests no formal military training. There's reasonable doubt they were ever in a formal war at all. That said, they have an uncanny ability to escape from the Vek using their stashes of flares and smoke bombs as distractions, and will purposefully throw themself in danger to have an excuse to use them.


As a bonus, using all 3 Hex Pilots packs allows you to replace every pilot in the hangar (except the starting pilot and secret pilots)
